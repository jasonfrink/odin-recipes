<h1>Martini</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At its most basic, a martini is gin or vodka and dry vermouth in certain proportions (usually 2 ½ oz. alcohol to ½ oz. vermouth), with an olive or lemon peel for garnish. Though it’s a super simple recipe, there are some adjustments you can make. Making a martini “dry” means using less vermouth and more vodka (“wet” means the opposite, though is less popular), and “dirty” adding a splash of olive juice with your olives. “Perfect” means using an equal amount of both, and “neat” means using room temperature ingredients, rather than ones shaken or stirred over ice. No matter which way you go at home, the most important thing is to start with good ingredients, since they’re the stars of the show.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 ounces dry gin</li>
    <li>1 ounce dry vermouth</li>
    <li>1 dash orange bitters (optional, but highly recommended)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
    <li>Place a sugar cube or sugar in an old-fashioned glass and saturate it with bitters. Muddle or stir to mix</li>
    <li>Add the whiskey, fill the glass with ice, and stir well.</li>
    <li>Express the orange peel over the drink before dropping it into the glass: Twist up the peel and give it a good squeeze (directed toward the glass, not your eyes) and bits of citrus oil will spray into the drink. Add a cherry if you like.</li>
</ol>
